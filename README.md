# Random-password-generator-website
A website that generates random combinations of letters, symbols and numbers, that can be used as passwords for people, who canâ€™t be bothered to create them themselves.

*This is version 1.0, that is made by using only the most basic tools (html, css, js), as in, no Bootstrap or frameworks were used. Later editions will use an MVC, such as the Laravel Framework.
