# random-password-generator-website
A website that generates random combinations of letters, symbols and numbers, that can be used as passwords for people, who canâ€™t be bothered to create them themselves.


## ToDo:
- Rework the footer,
- Copy button only appears when a password has been generated,
- Change up the content layout/ remove some of the text.
