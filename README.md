# Random-password-generator-website
A website that generates random combinations of letters, symbols and numbers, that can be used as passwords for people, who canâ€™t be bothered to create them themselves.

*This is version 1.0, that is made by using only the most basic tools (html, css, js), as in, no Bootstrap or frameworks were used. Later editions will use an MVC, such as the Laravel Framework.

## Note: Project isn't finished.

todo:
- need to finish the other pages of the website;
- need to rework the JS and HTML components for the main functionality of the passwords output (has to fit its given area);
- bugs need to be ironed out and logo/favicon reworked.
